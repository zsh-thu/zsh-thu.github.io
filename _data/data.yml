    title: About me
    summary: |
      Hi there~ Thank you for visiting my personal website! 

      I am Sihan Zeng, a master student of MSIT (Information Technology) program at Carnegie Mellon University.
      I am actively looking for a full-time software engineer position starting in 2020.

education:
    - degree: MSc in Information Technology
      university: Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, US
      time: Aug 2018 - Dec 2019
      details: |
          - Selected courses: Search Engines(A), Introduction to Computer Systems(A), Distributed Systems(A), Advanced Cloud Computing(A), Computer Networks(A), Introduction to Deep Learning(A-)
          - Teaching Assistant for Search Engines

    - degree: BEng in Electronic Engineering
      university: Tsinghua University, Beijing, China
      time: Aug 2014 - Jun 2018
      details: |
          - Selected courses: Database(A+), Machine Learning(A), 
          Data Structure and Algorithm(A), Operating System(A-)
          - Outstanding Graduate Honor

experiences:
    - role: Software Engineer Intern
      time: May 2019 - Aug 2019
      company: Uber Technology, Seattle, US
      details: |
          - Contributed to [Horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod), an open-source distributed training framework for Tensorflow and PyTorch.
          - Re-designed the coordination logic to decouple from MPI and implemented an alternative based on Gloo (a collective communication framework) for aggregating gradient updates among distributed workers.
          - Designed a rendezvous server based on HTTP protocol to launch and orchestrate jobs on distributed workers.
          - Achieved comparable performance (distributed training speed) to MPI while empowered the ability for elastic training, i.e. distributed model training is unaffected from individual node failures or insertions.

    - role: Software Engineer Intern
      time: May 2017 - Sep 2017
      company: ET International, Wilmington, US
      details: |
          - Designed a C++ framework for Convolutional Neural Network using codelet execution model.
          - Achieved 26% faster processing speed than vanilla Tensorflow for AlexNet inference on CPU.
          - Built APIs for users to use the framework without the knowledge of underlying execution model.

    - role: Software Engineer Intern
      time: Sep 2016 - Mar 2017
      company: Tencent, Beijing, China
      details: |
          - Designed a Markov-chain based location prediction system that uses history trajectories to predict user location.
          - Implemented Gibbs sampling to achieve 34% higher prediction accuracy than baseline on sparse trajectories.
          - Deployed on Hadoop cluster using Hadoop Streaming for production and adopted by Tencent Map Service.

    assignments:
      - title: Iterative Machine Learning Training on Spark
        details: |
          - Built an ELT preprocessing workflow to construct features on a large-scale web crawled news data.
          - Implemented a logistic-regression model trained on billions of features to classify the news.
          - Optimized the Spark workflow to reduce the memory usage by 3x and execution time by 2x.

      - title: Text-oriented Search Engine
        details: |
          - Designed a text search engine in Java based on Lucene and supported various retrieval models, including Vector Space Model, BM25, Indri.
          - Implemented SVM Rank to train a feature-based retrieval model to improve the quality of retrieval ranking.
          - Implemented diversification algorithms (xQuAD and PM-2) to generate diversified retrieval results.

      - title: Event Extraction from Medical records
        details: |
          - Designed an end-to-end deep learning system that consists of a CNN feature extractor and a CRF sequence labeler to extract medical events from medical record text.
          - Proposed a smoothed Viterbi decoder with better generalization ability and less trainable parameters.
          - Achieved 92.6% classification accuracy and 300 sentences/second prediction speed on a single 1080ti GPU.
          - Built a demo system with UI that can classify and colorize different events for raw medical records inputs.
